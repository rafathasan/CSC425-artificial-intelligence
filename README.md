# CSC 425: Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Project Topics
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

### Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of making optimal decisions given incomplete information and limited resources. This unit covers the foundational concepts and programming techniques of AI: search and problem solving methods, knowledge representation, reasoning, intelligent agents and natural language processing. Additional aspects of AI discussed include logic, uncertainty, puzzle solvers, simulative and cognitive process, expert systems and data processing.

### Prerequisites
- CSC 306 + Lab : Algorithms
