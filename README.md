Admission Prediction System
The Admission Prediction System is a project developed during my undergraduate studies to automate the evaluation of prospective students based on their profile scores. This repository contains the code and resources for the system, which leverages the power of neural networks to predict admission outcomes.

Features
Utilizes a robust neural network model to evaluate prospective students' profiles.
Handles data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.
Implements feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information from the profile data.
Provides an intuitive user interface for administrators to input profile data and obtain predictions quickly.
Key Contributions
Developed and optimized the neural network model to improve its predictive capabilities.
Explored the latent space of neural networks and introduced new components to enhance the system's performance.
Conducted analyses, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to gain insights into the results and further improve predictions.
